# edge-lockdrop

To align incentives, the Edgeware network will be launched with a lockdrop of EDG tokens to Ether holders. A lockdrop happens where token holders on one network timelock their tokens for a certain amount of time — all executed within a smart contract. Ether holders are able to lock their tokens for as short as 3 months or as long as one year. With longer timelocks corresponding to receiving proportionally more Edgeware tokens.
